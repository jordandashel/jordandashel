		<h1>My Dev Work</h1>
		<div class="text">
			<p>I was brought up in the Test-First school of teaching, with an 
			emphasis on code as craft. I make sure the code I write is functional,
			flexible, and above all, clean and easy-to-read.</p>
			<p>My realm of comfort is firmly in the *nix family; I am best with Python
			and Linux. On my teams, I've always been the one to go to for scripts and
			automation: <span title="All style... just enough substance.">Ruby</span>, 
			<span title="The hardest workin' language in computer business.">BASH</span>, 
			<span title="Write-Only... granted. Not necessarily a weakness.">Perl
			</span>... I love my scripting languages! I've also worked with kludgers
			like Java and C#.</p>
			<p>I use and adore both <span title="For no nonesense code manipulation.">
			VIM</span> and 
			<span title="For all other text editing, org-mode, LISPs...">EMACS</span> 
			-- different tools for different jobs :)</p>

			<h3>At Nordstrom</h3>
			<h4>AMP Color Extraction</h4>
			<p>I was tasked with taking on a high-profile machine learning collaboration
			with an in house data scientist. This project is now supporting a team of
			its own.</p> 
			
			<p>Our data scientist, Aaron, wrote an algorithm that could look at a
			picture of an item of clothing and determine the colors and distribution
			thereof in the item. It could then convert those RGB values into plain human
			language. For example, (200, 162, 200) -&gt "lilac". My job was to turn that
			into a production-ready web service. I wrote a Django wrapper around it and
			turned it into an EBS web app. Then I ran the service against a dozen
			million assets, storing the computed assets in a DynamoDb for quick
			lookup.</p>
			
			<h4>Migration to Kubernetes Plan</h4> 
			<p>My team was heavily dependent on AWS's Elastic Beanstalk to support our
			network of approx. a dozen applications. My task was to first do a proof of
			concept of our applications in Docker Containers and then determine the pros
			and cons of a half dozen orchestration services. I was perfect for this task
			given my role on the team of tackling Ops issues, especially when stepping
			out of the java environment into the nuts and bolts of Linux VMs.</p> 

			<p>I built the team a tutorial course for using Docker and K8s, gave a ream
			of documentation and notes, and finally a suggestion for a path forward.</p>

			<h3>My Own Work</h3> 
			<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/jordandashel/chesster">chesster</a></h4>
			<p>I enjoy chess and I am getting more into it. I was trying to follow along
			in the chess books I am reading but setting up a full chess board for
			example situations was such a hassle. I wanted a digital board I could set
			up and play with as I liked. All the chess apps I could find were only for
			<em>playing</em> chess, against people or the computer. I wanted one I could
			mess with just like a normal board. So I made this.</p> 

			<p>It is a strong indicator of how I program. It has unit tests (but no
			integration tests yet!  -- coming soon) and is mostly following what I
			consider to be good coding practice. It's a good demo of code I could be
			writing for you.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://gitlab.com/jordandashel/jordandashel">This Website</a></h4> 
			<p>Many times I have wished I could quickly show someone some of the work
			I've done! Wether as a programmer, an artist, or if I just want to expose
			them to my crazy 3-month bike trip! So I made this cute little Flask app in
			GCP :)</p>
